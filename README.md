## Setup for Game Night! - How to Play ##

### üè† Playing Remotely (Different Locations)

When playing with friends who aren't in the same physical location:

üéß **Join a voice call together** - Use Zoom, Discord, Teams, Facetime, or any voice chat platform
üëâ **Choose the clue when you have board control** - Click on any clue to select it
üëÄ **Wait until the buzzer opens** - The clue will be read aloud and the buzzer will activate
üö® **Buzz in when you know the answer** - Click the buzzer button as fast as you can!
üó£Ô∏è **Fastest buzzer guesses out loud on the call** - Say your answer to everyone.
üôä **Fastest buzzer checks the correct answer privately** - Don't say the answer out loud!
‚ö°  **Swoop in when others are wrong** - If the first person is incorrect, others can buzz in
‚öñÔ∏è **Wager carefully on hidden Double Down clues** - Some clues have special wagering rules

### üè† Playing in the Same Place (Host Mode)

When everyone is physically together, use **Host Mode** for the best experience:

#### Step 1: Set Up Your Host Device (This user does not play)
1. **Create your account** and start a game
2. **Go to Host Mode** by adding `?mode=host` to your room URL: `room/<roomID>?mode=host`
3. **Enter your name** or add "HOST" as your name for so others know. First person in takes control of the board.
4. **Use this device** (iPad, tablet, or laptop) as your **HOST board device** - this controls the game flow

#### Step 2: Set Up Your Display Device
1. **Login as the same user** on another device (phone, tablet, or laptop)
2. **Go to the regular room page**: `room/<roomID>` (without the `?mode=host` parameter)
3. **Connect this device** to your main TV via HDMI or screen casting
4. **This becomes your display device** - showing the game board, clues, and answers on the big screen

#### Step 3: Player Devices
- **Each player** uses their own phone/device to join the same room link when the host is ready
- **Enter your name** or keep the random emoji generated for you and join the game
- **The main TV** shows the game for spectators and the players to follow along

#### Host Mode Benefits:
- **Host controls the game flow** from their device
- **Main TV displays** the current game state for everyone to see
- **Players interact** on their individual devices
- **Spectators can watch** the game progress on the big screen
- **Perfect for game nights** where some people want to watch and others want to play

### How to Buzz
Practice your buzzing skills on the `/howto` page. The clue will be shown and the buzzer will be "Open" for buzzing once the initial "open buzzer" timer is complete. You will see a visual reference of when the buzzer opens at the top of the page when the clue is being read.

Buzz in too early and you will get a `250ms` lockout before you can buzz again! Happy buzzing!

### üéÆ Game Controls

- **Click any clue** to select it
- **Click the buzzer** when you want to answer
- **Click "Check Answer"** to see if you're correct
- **Use the wager form** for Daily Double and Final Jeopardy clues
